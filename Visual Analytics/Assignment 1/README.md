# Assignment 1 - Visual analytics 
This is my first assignment in the portfolio assignment in Visual Analytics, enjoy!

Goal for assignment: 
- For this assignment, you will write a small Python program to compare image histograms quantitively using Open-CV and the other image processing tools you've already encountered. 

The tasks in the assignment is: 
- Take a user-defined image from the folder
- Calculate the "distance" between the colour histogram of that image and all of the others.
- Find which 3 image are most "similar" to the target image.
- Save an image which shows the target image, the three most similar, and the calculated distance score.
- Save a CSV which has one column for the filename and three columns showing the filenames of the closest images in descending order


```python

```
